# YOLO Model Training

Datasets:

-   Source: [antoreepjana - Animals Detection Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoreepjana/animals-detection-images-dataset).
-   Filtered: [20 chosen classes](https://kaggle.com/datasets/5228c8f6b89b26721a7ce9493a8cc751b0ee07f1f201bddad1742ab15147de2e).
-   Post-processing: [In YOLO format](https://kaggle.com/datasets/f9b375eef26f759b115050a2399e12816bcd232322eb6fc2c1fccc1a6b53845e).

## [Ultralytics' YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/)

-   The actual training was done on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anphongtrannguyen).
-   Models should be saved to `../src/static/models`.

## [Tianxiaomo's pytorch-YOLOv4](https://github.com/Tianxiaomo/pytorch-YOLOv4)

-   The [training](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bba25fe160bd58422a44e72f36134f7b4274b84e31fca1e2d0f7e7fa6fae1540) and [model](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/33935b3727dcae6767f142c22b6dd031cc850948744815878e8b785944fd0ec3) were done and hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anphongtrannguyen).
-   This won't be implemented in the website, as it would be too convoluted, and the produced models are too large.
